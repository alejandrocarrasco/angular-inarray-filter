Add the 'inArray' filter included in filters.js file directly to your filters folder/file\r\n2. Use angular notation to filter your repeaters:\r\n* Filter by specific elements of the array:\r\n```<span ng-repeat='element in array | inArray:filterArray:\"id\"'>{{element.id}} </span>```\r\nwhere **inArray** is the filter, **filterArray** (the first argument of this filter) is your array to match against, and \"id\" (second argument) is the element of the list you want to match against the array\r\n* Filter a plain array:\r\n```<span ng-repeat='element in plainArray | inArray:filterArray'>{{element}} </span>```\r\nwhere **inArray** is the filter, **filterArray** (the first argument of this filter) is your array to match against your plain array.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis directive is created by Alejandro Carrasco (@alejandrocarrasco) and is released under the MIT License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
